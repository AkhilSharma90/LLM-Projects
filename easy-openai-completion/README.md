# LangChainGo OpenAI Text Generation Example

## Overview

This is a simple Go project demonstrating how to use the LangChainGo library to generate text using OpenAI's language model. The example generates a completion for the prompt "The first man to walk on the moon" with some custom parameters.

## Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.16 or later)
- OpenAI API Key

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system.
2. Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

## Dependencies

This project uses the following key dependencies:

- `github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms`
- `github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms/openai`

## Installation of Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
go mod init your-project-name
go get github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms
go get github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms/openai
```

## Running the Project

To run the project:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Key Features

- Uses LangChainGo library for language model interaction
- Demonstrates OpenAI API integration
- Shows how to:
  - Initialize an OpenAI language model
  - Generate text with custom parameters
  - Handle potential errors

## Customization

You can modify the following parameters in the code:

- Prompt text
- Temperature (creativity of the response)
- Stop words

## Error Handling

The code includes basic error handling:

- Checks for errors when initializing the OpenAI client
- Handles potential errors during text generation
